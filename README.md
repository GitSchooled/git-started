# gTerm
gTerm is a Mac desktop application for beginning developers who are just starting to use Git and the terminal. Built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), gTerm combines a terminal emulator with animations of your file structure and Git status. The goal is to help you visualize what happens when you run terminal commands.

gTerm also includes a lesson on Git and terminal basics. As you progress through the lesson, gTerm gives you feedback on whether you're running these commands correctly. We hope to add more lessons in the future on topics like GitHub.
